## 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

**Description**:
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return a list of values of the nodes that are visible from the right side of the tree. The right side view of a binary tree is defined as the set of nodes you can see when looking at the tree from the right side.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Input: [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1, 3, 4]
Explanation:
    1            <---
   / \
  2   3         <---
   \   \
    5   4       <---
```

**Solution**:
The solution performs a level-order traversal (BFS) of the tree, keeping track of the rightmost node at each level. For each level, the rightmost node is added to the result. The queue helps in performing the traversal, ensuring that we visit nodes level by level, from left to right, and then capture the rightmost node of each level.

**Notes**:
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Space complexity: O(n), due to the space used by the queue during level-order traversal.

## 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

**Description**:
Given the root of a binary tree, count the number of "good" nodes. A node is considered "good" if, along the path from the root to the node, there is no node with a greater value than the current node.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Input: [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes 3, 3, 4, and 5 are good.
```

**Solution**:
The problem can be solved using a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the tree. During the traversal, keep track of the maximum value encountered so far along the path. If the current nodeâ€™s value is greater than or equal to this maximum, it is considered a "good" node. For each node, we recursively explore the left and right subtrees, updating the maximum value.

**Notes**:
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we need to visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
