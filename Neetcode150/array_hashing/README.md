## 217. Contains Duplicate

**Description**:
Given an integer array `nums`, return `True` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `False` if every element is distinct.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: True
```

**Solution**:
To determine if the array contains duplicates, we can use a set to track the unique elements as we iterate through the array. If we encounter an element that is already in the set, we return `True`. If we finish iterating without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.

**Notes**:
- **Time complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each insertion and lookup in the set is O(1) on average.
- **Space complexity**: O(n), as we store up to n elements in the set.
